Production Critical â†’ Start with Quick Reference, escalate if needed
```

**Step 2: Follow the Process**
- **Never skip methodology phases** for complex issues
- **Always create comprehensive test suites**
- **Always preserve existing business logic**
- **Always validate with static analysis**

**Step 3: Document Results**
- Record error patterns and solutions
- Update knowledge base with new findings
- Track success metrics and improvement areas
- Contribute back to methodology evolution

### **For Development Teams**

**Integration Options:**
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - Automated debugging checks
2. **Code Review Integration** - Debugging-focused review checklists
3. **Monitoring Integration** - Production error detection and classification
