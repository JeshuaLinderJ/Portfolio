# 🚨 Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem Diagnosis
Your project is being deployed as a **Cloudflare Worker** instead of a **Cloudflare Pages** static site, causing the `npx wrangler deploy` error.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option A: Delete and Recreate Project (Recommended)

1. **Delete Current Project**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → **Pages**
   - Find your portfolio project
   - Click **Settings** → **Danger Zone** → **Delete Project**

2. **Create New Pages Project**:
   - Click **Create a project**
   - Select **Connect to Git** (NOT "Direct Upload" or "Workers")
   - Choose **GitHub** and select `JeshuaLinderJ/Portfolio`
   - **CRITICAL**: Ensure you're in the **Pages** section, not Workers

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   ```
   Project name: jeshua-portfolio (or your preferred name)
   Production branch: main
   Framework preset: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
   Build command: npm run build
   Build output directory: out
   Root directory: (leave empty)
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_VERSION: 18
   ```

### Option B: Fix Existing Project Settings

If you can't delete the project:

1. **Go to Project Settings**:
   - Cloudflare Dashboard → **Pages** → Your Project → **Settings**

2. **Update Build Configuration**:
   - **Build command**: Change from `npx wrangler deploy` to `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: Set to `out`
   - **Root directory**: Leave empty

3. **Remove Worker Configuration**:
   - Look for any "Functions" or "Workers" settings
   - Disable or remove any Worker-related configurations

## 🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS

### Before Deployment:
- ✅ Verify `next.config.ts` has `output: 'export'`
- ✅ Confirm `npm run build` creates `out/` directory locally
- ✅ Check no `wrangler.toml` file exists in repository

### During Deployment:
- ✅ Build logs should show `npm run build` (NOT wrangler)
- ✅ Build should generate static files in `out/`
- ✅ No Worker-related error messages

### After Deployment:
- ✅ Site accessible at `https://[project-name].pages.dev`
- ✅ All routes working correctly
- ✅ Resume download functional

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Wrong Section**: Don't use "Workers & Pages" → Use **Pages** only
2. **Wrong Framework**: Don't select "Next.js" → Use "Next.js (Static HTML Export)"
3. **Wrong Build Command**: Don't use `npx wrangler deploy` → Use `npm run build`
4. **Wrong Output**: Don't use `.next` → Use `out`

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Still Getting Wrangler Errors:
1. Check if you accidentally created a Worker project
2. Verify you're in the **Pages** dashboard section
3. Ensure build output directory is set to `out`
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Node.js version is 18+
2. Verify `package.json` has correct dependencies
3. Test `npm run build` locally first

### If Site Doesn't Load:
1. Check `out/index.html` exists after build
2. Verify `_redirects` file is in `out/` directory
3. Check browser console for errors

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACT

If the above doesn't work:
1. Screenshot your current Cloudflare Pages settings
2. Share the exact error message from build logs
3. Confirm you're using **Pages** not **Workers & Pages**
